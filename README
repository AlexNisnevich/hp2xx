hp2xx-3.3.1

This is primarily a bug-fix release to address some problems introduced
with 3.3.0, my first 'new' release of hp2xx, the HPGL converter originally 
developed by Heinz Werntges. 

I would greatly appreciate receiving bug reports, patches or even sample 
HPGL files. (In the latter case, please make sure that no copyright or 
confidentiality agreements are violated before sending any materials.)
