hp2xx-3.3.2

This is yet another bug-fix release to address some problems introduced
with 3.3.0, my first 'new' release of hp2xx, the HPGL converter originally 
developed by Heinz Werntges. Major additions, most notably polygon support,
will go into 3.4, a first alpha of which should be available by March 1,2000.

I would greatly appreciate receiving bug reports, patches or even sample 
HPGL files. (In the latter case, please make sure that no copyright or 
confidentiality agreements are violated before sending any materials.)
