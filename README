I would greatly appreciate receiving bug reports, patches or even sample 
HPGL files. (In the latter case, please make sure that no copyright or

Changes from 3.4.4 to 3.5.0

New features:

- Support for drivers that provide native routines for polygon filling
  (currently implemented in a new postscript driver) (Eugene Doudine).
- Support for filltypes 10 (percentage) and 11 (user-defined pattern) and
  the RF command
- PDF output generator can optionally be built using Takeshi Kanno's 
  libharu (sourceforge.net), which has a much less restrictive license 
  than PDFLIB.
- GIF output module
- much improved, plotter-like HP-GL error handling (ignoring malformed commands
  and parameters that are out of range; setting/querying of error status) 
- Optional support for the old, simple method of drawing wider lines through
  the -u commandline parameter. 


Bug fixes:

- Corrected the implementation of the AT command
- Fixed several cases where pen down/pen up sequences did not create a dot
- Added missing quotation marks in some Makefile templates
- made hp2xx handle lowercase HPGL commands 
- Files containing polygons and SCaling had an extra margin added and/or
  some polygons not filled correctly in some cases.
- fig and rgip modules aborted when the color of pen 0 was changed
- penwidth always reverted to that of pen 1 after polygon filling.
- Corrected several bugs in the miter code for wide lines, which could
  cause both jagged appearance of line sequences and extraneous lines 
  being drawn.
- Polygons drawn with raised pen were not rendered.
- Scaling of polygons could turn solid fills into striped patterns.
- When a single SD or AD command contained more than one font option,
  only the first one was read.
- Clipping of circles and arcs added a line from the center to the new
  starting point in some cases.
- IW sometimes clipped labels when it should not.
- When PG was encountered before any actual drawing commands had been 
  received (i.e., a file started with only a few escape sequences for hardware
  setup), hp2xx would terminate even if there was more input available.
- Square line ends were not rendered correctly.
- The Esc-E PCL reset sequence was not recognized and could cause further
  mis-reading of subsequent commands
