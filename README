hp2xx-3.3.0

Several years have passed now since the last release, 3.2.0, of HP2XX was
made by its original author, Heinz W. Werntges. 
As both the FSF and the previous contributors to hp2xx have lost contact
with him, i have combined my own extensions to his work with the existing
patches pointed out or sent to me by people i contacted in my search or who
were put in touch with me by the FSF. 

I would greatly appreciate receiving bug reports, patches or even sample 
HPGL files. (In the latter case, please make sure that no copyright or 
confidentiality agreements are violated before sending any materials.)
