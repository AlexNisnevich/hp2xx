hp2xx-3.4.4 (to be released sometime in early 2003)

This is mainly a bugfix release to correct some problems found in 3.4.3.
In addition, it provides a tentative framework for truetype font support
and a few other minor enhancements.
I would greatly appreciate receiving bug reports, patches or even sample 
HPGL files. (In the latter case, please make sure that no copyright or 
confidentiality agreements are violated before sending any materials.)

Changes from 3.4.3 to 3.4.4

New features:

- Experimental support for truetype fonts (needs a fixed-width truetype
  font and '-DSTROKED_FONTS=\"/path/to/this/truetype/font.ttf\"' in the
  DEFINES section of the Makefile) 
- Support for the rectangle mode of the PE statement (Eugene Doudine)
- NR is now recognized as an image terminator in multi-plot files.
- DXF output provides optional translation of pen number and/or width
  into DXF group 62 line attributes (Georg Viehoever).

Bug fixes:

- penwidth was erroneously set to the default 0.1 mm after drawing a label
- xfig and rgip output did not yet handle the changed pencolor and width
  settings
- polygons sometimes had the wrong sections filled in for some of the 
  scanlines
- forcing penwidth via the -p commandline option no longer worked for 
  the conventional values between 1 and 9 
- PJL parser now handles input lines of up to 256 characters 
- polygon sides could escape clipping in some circumstances
- simplified HPGL output would write very small numbers in exponential
  notation, which is not allowed by any HPGL standard.
