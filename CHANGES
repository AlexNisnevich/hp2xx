Changes from 3.3.1 to 3.3.2

New features:

- Added TIFF output mode (provided by M.Liberi) based on libtiff. Uses ZIP
  deflate compression to avoid LZW patent issues at the risk of reduced
  portability.
- DV command (vertical text)

Bug fixes:

- Command line options for pen color and pen width take precedence over PC
  or PW statements in the HPGL file now. This allows creation of PBM bitmaps
  instead of PPM pixmaps from color plots again (by setting all pens to 
  black, -c11111111), and should also help for programs that use several pens 
  at constant widths, but emit global PW commands with every SP statement. 
  A true fix for the latter case would require keeping track of the current 
  pen settings for every line in the internal metaformat (maybe in 3.4)

- Removed the A4 size limitation for Encapsulated PostScript output 

- Default 20x20 plot size calculation was broken for Landscape format

- Black pen was displayed as light gray in X11 preview, now uses a very dark
  gray (gray10) 

- pen color was not decoded correctly in PE pencolor statements

- output file was closed twice in to_eps.c, which could cause a segmentation
  fault inside (g)libc if hp2xx was used in batch mode

Changes from 3.3.0 to 3.3.1

New features:
- PE with fractional coordinates (completes PE support)
- unlimited label lengths through dynamic reallocation of LB memory

Bug fixes:
- PS/RO handling was still broken, should be fixed now
- xfig file headers had erroneously claimed 3.2 compliance, but the files
  still had 3.1 format
- Makefiles in ~/makes updated 
- DR and DI did not initialize character properties when called without
  parameters
- Current address of Michael Schmitz added to documentation 
- removed leftover PCL file acad.pcl from hp-tests 

Changes from 3.3.ALPHA2 to 3.3.0

New features:
(none)

Bug fixes: 

- Combinations of PS, RO and the -r command line switch could lead to
  wrong scaling
- the position of a clipping box was miscalculated for labels

Changes from 3.3.ALPHA to 3.3.ALPHA2:

New features:

- the PS (plot size) command is now supported, allowing 'white space'
  around plots
- support for the EW (edge wedge) command

Bug fixes:

- PC support in 3.3.ALPHA was still limited to 8 colors
- PW had the parameters backwards and no provision for the 
  'set them all to this value' variant
- tick marks were scaled incorrectly (long-standing bug)
- EA advanced pen position (long-standing bug)

Changes from 3.2.0 to 3.3.ALPHA:

New features:

- Character set support for fonts 1-7, and the 'upper half' of font 0.
- Support for most character-related commands (CA,CS,SA,SS)
- Support for the IW (input window, i.e. clipping) command
- Partial support for the PE (polyline encoded) command (integer coords only)
- Output generation for Brian Smith's XFig
- Output generation for Gnuplot
- Output generation in PNG format
- Automatic medium size selection code in the PCL initialization sequence
- Centering (-C) now supported even in true-size (-t) mode
- HPGL/2 Pen Color and Pen Width support for up to 256 virtual pens
