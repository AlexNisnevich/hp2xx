- There are still lots of unsupported fonts, and some of the existing
  characters are ugly (and perhaps even wrong), as i sketched them after
  the small illustrations in an old manual.
- Polygon commands need more testing.
- [full] color support may be buggy in some modes, and is not implemented
  in the Sun, OS/2 and MS Windows modules
- The OS/2 PM and other modules that H.Werntges had already marked as
  'unsupported' in 3.2.0 have now fallen even farther behind
- to_vga, to_atari and to_sunvw do not yet support more than eight colors
  (contributions from MS DOS/Windows, OS/2, Atari and Sun users needed).
- A 'Pan' mode for the X previewer a la ImageMagick
- Allow redefinition of PenColor in raster graphics modes
- Optionally use an output formats' text commands where available, instead 
  of converting LB characters to line drawings
