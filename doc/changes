Changes to hp2xx:
=================

V 3.3.2     , 00/02/12:

Added flags to make the command line options -c and -s override any PC or PW 
commands in the HPGL file. (One can now force monochrome output from a color 
hpgl file again, and work around silly programs that use global PW at every 
pen change). Fixed autoscaling of plot in landscape mode and interpretation
of PE pen change commands. Removed artificial A4 page limitation in Postscript
mode. Documented the automatic selection between PBM and PPM file formats 
done in pbm mode. Changed color for 'black' pen in to_x11.c from (light) 
gray to gray10. Added TIFF output module provided by M.Liberi after changing 
requested compression from LZW to DEFLATE, added TIFF and PNG defines to 
generic.mak. Added support for DV (vertical text).

V 3.3.1     , 99/11/20:

Changed handling of PS/RO to finally(?) eliminate the scaling problems.
Corrected xfig file header (had FIG3.2 title but 3.1-style parameters). 
Added Solaris/SunOS 5.x options for generic.mak (suggested by Wolfram Wagner),
fixed all files in generic.mak that did not yet include to_fig.c and clip.c.
Fixed DR/DI implementation to do correct initialization when called without 
parameters, changed text height factor to better resemble plotter output, 
(re)allocate LB strings dynamically instead of imposing arbitrary limit on 
label length (patches supplied by Georgy Salnikov). Completed PE support.
Cosmetic changes to compile without warnings with gcc -Wall. 
Added Michael Schmitz' current email address in to_png.c.

V 3.3.0     , 99/09/30:

Corrected scaling of PS with RO and -r. Corrected positioning and scaling
of clipping box for LB with IW. Removed BF from the list of unsupported 
commands, as none of my HP-GL references mentions such a command.

V 3.3 ALPHA2, 99/09/12:

Corrected interpretation of PW (parameter list was backwards and there
was no provision for the 'default' cases),  added support for NP and
>8 pens, added PS (plot size) command to accurately reproduce page
position, added EW (edge wedge) command support. Removed improper scaling
of tick marks in ax_ticks(). Corrected rect(), which was advancing the
pen position after an EA.

=====================================================================

V 3.3 ALPHA,  99/09/01:

Incorporated PNG support (patches by Michael Schmitz as packaged
by Lars Koeller for FreeBSD) and partial support for the PE command
(by Eugene Doudine). Added more character sets, so that 0-7 are now
supported (although some glyphs may be ugly or even wrong, they were
drawn after the small illustrations in an old plotter manual). Added
PenColor and PenWidth commands from HPGL/2 (not yet supported in the
old Sun and OS/2 output modules - help needed for these platforms).
PCL initialization sequence changed to use maximum available area in
"-t" mode and generate paper selection commands for formats larger than
A3 (untested).

=====================================================================


V 3.30.0, 99/01/31: (unreleased) 

First version packaged by new maintainer (this is what you get when you
ask where to send patches for an orphaned project).
Output functions for xfig (by Ian McPhedran) and gnuplot (by Emmanuel Bigler).
Support for the HP-GL commands IW (clipping) and CS (character set selection),
implementation of character sets 5 (Special Symbols) and 7 (HP Roman8 
Extensions), and support for 8bit addressing of charset 7 from charset 0.
PCL initialization sequence now includes appropriate paper size selection 
when in "-t" mode (European A4 and A3 formats only), as some (most?) printers 
do not select the larger size automatically.



======================================================================

NOTES:
     o  Intermediate versions have not been made publicly available.
     o  Letters at end of version number indicate small changes like
        source restructuring or minor bug fixes.


V 3.20a, 94/02/15:

This release contains major modifications. Besides a lot of cleamup it
deals with the introduction of high-level functions which represent
the different conversion phases of hp2xx. These may be called by *any*
user front-end, not just the traditional command line interface.

My intention is to facilitate the introduction of various graphical
user front-ends. If you want to add one, study function "action_traditional"
and read the comments in "hp2xx.h"!


	-- hp2xx.h:     Re-structured! Options & parameters now separated into
	                three groups: General / for input / for output conversion
	-- hp2xx.c:     Now with high-level routines suitable for future
	                GUI front-ends.
	                CLI functions incl. main() moved to "std_main.c"
	-- std_main.c:  New file! Keeps functions for traditional command line interface.
	                PCL mode now also accepts 600 DPI.
	-- hpgl.c:      Bug fixed: Gap in min/max determination caused later crash
	-- to_pbm.c:    Color supported + compact binary format (by Ian McPhedran)
	-- most files:    o  Adapted to new parameter structs
	                  o  Re-organized
	                  o  Use of "const"
	                  o  Better error recovery
	                  o  Direct output to stderr now eliminated (see std_main.c)
	Plus all changes later than 3.14a
